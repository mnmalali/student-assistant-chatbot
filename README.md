# Student Assistant Chatbot (RAG Based Course Information Assistant)

This project implements a Student Assistant Chatbot that helps Computer Science students access detailed and verified information about university course structures, prerequisites, credit hours, and study plans using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.
The system uses OpenAI models, LangChain, and ChromaDB to ensure all responses are grounded in official study plan documents.
